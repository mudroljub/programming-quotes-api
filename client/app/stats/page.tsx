      Programming Quotes is a place where I collect quotes and thoughts from the world of programming that have inspired me over the years. From wisdom that makes us think, to the fun ones that remind us not to take ourselves too seriously â€“ there's something here for every programmer. This site is my way of sharing those little moments of inspiration and reminding myself (and you) why we love coding. Whether you're a programming veteran or just starting out, I hope you enjoy the quotes and maybe find one that speaks to you.
