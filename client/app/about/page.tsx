      Programming Quotes is a place where I’ve been collecting quotes and thoughts from the world of programming for years. These quotes are my way of reminding myself why I love coding.</p> 
      
      <p className="mt-4">From deep wisdom to fun ones that remind us not to take ourselves too seriously – there’s something here for every programmer. Whether you’re a veteran or just starting out, I hope you enjoy the quotes and maybe find one that speaks to you.
